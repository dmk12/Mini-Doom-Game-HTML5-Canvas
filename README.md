## HTML5 Canvas Doom inspired game
This is a small project for fun - a mini version of Doom, or Doom-inspired 2D shooter game yo can play in the browser.
It's done with JavaScript on HTML5 Canvas, uses a sprite image for the graphics, and a library called Easel.js for animations and sounds. It also uses a manifest file for caching assets.
It has only two levels and no work was put in so far to make it easily scalable for adding more.
